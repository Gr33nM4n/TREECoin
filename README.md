Protection, Maintenance, Expansion and Studies of the Natural World through Virtualization
Raised by trees, I learned the value, beauty and necessity of the natural world with first-hand experience. My life's mission is to protect the existing global tree canopy and even assist with it's expansion. I've spent the last 26 years endlessly working to figure out how to educate the world on the importance of trees and have always strived to alter people's perspective on the beneifts and values of having trees in and around our living spaces. After a couple decades of relentlessly learning, teaching and writing about why trees are so important, people started to call me Green Man.
Last year I was introduced to blockchain technology and knowing nothing about computer coding and havin very little web design experience, I decided to jump all in and take some online classes to learn some of the popular programming languages that exist today. As I learned to build IOS apps and use solidity to run smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, I realized that I had transformed and had evolved into Gr33n M4n. 
Now I am working to protect our green friends by virtualizing them into the digital world and assigning them a cryptocurrency value.
